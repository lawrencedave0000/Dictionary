"COMPUTER": "AN ELECTRONIC DEVICE",
"ABACUS": "INVENTED BY CHINESE AROUND 4000 YEARS AGO AND BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST COMPUTER, IT IS BASICALLY A WOODEN RACK THAT HAS METAL RODS WITH BEADS MOUNTED ON THEM. THE BEADS WERE MOVED BY THE OPERATOR ACCORDING TO SOME RULES TO PERFORM ARITHMETIC CALCULATIONS",
"NAPIER'S BONES": "INVENTED BY JOHN NAPIER, IT WAS A MANUALLY OPERATED CALCULATING DEVICE. IN THIS DEVUCE, HE USED 9 DIFFERENT IVORY STRIPS (BONES) MARKED WITH NUMBERS TO MULTIPLY AND DIVIDE FOR CALCULATIONS",
"PASCALINE": "ALSO CALLED AN ARITHMETIC MACHINE OR ADDING MACHINE, INVENTED BY MATHEMATICIAN-PHILOSOPHER BLAISE PASCAL BETWEEN 1642-1644. IT WAS BASICALLY A WOODEN BOX WITH A SERIES OF GEARS AND WHEELS. IT IS WORKED BY ROTATING WHEEL LIKE WHEN A ROTATED IN ONE REVOLUTION, IT ROTATES THE NEIGHBOURING WHEEL AND A SERIES OF WINDOWS ARE GIVEN ON THE TOP OF THE WHEELS TO READ THE TOTALS",
"STEPPED RECKONER OR LEIBNIZ WHEEL": "DEVELOPED BY GERMAN MATHEMATICIAN-PHILOSOPHER GOTTFRIED WILHELM LEIBNIZ IN 1673. IT WAS BASICALLY A DIGITAL MECHANICAL CALCULATOR, MADE OF FLUTED DRUMS INSTEAD OF GEARS (USED IN PREVIOUS MODEL OF PASCALINE)",
"ANALYTICAL ENGINE": "DEVELOPED BY CHARLES BABBAGE IN 1830. IT WAD A MECHANICAL COMPUTER THAT USED PUNCH CARDS AS INPUT. IT WAS CAPABLE OF PERFORMING ANY MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM AND STORING INFORMATION AS A PERMANENT MEMORY (STORAGE)",
"TABULATING MACHINE": "INVENTED BY AN AMERICAN STATISTICIAN HERMAN HOLLERITH IN THE YEAR 1890. IT WAS A MECHANICAL TABULATOR THAT WAS BASED ON PUNCH CARDS",
"DIFFERENCIAL ANALYZER": "INVENTED BY VANNEVAR BUSH IN THE YEAR 1930, THE FIRST EELCTRONIC COMPUTER INTRODUCED IN THE UNITED STATES",
"MARK I": "IN THE YEAR 1937, HOWARD AIKEN PLANNED TO DEVELOP A MACHINE THAT COULD PERFORM LARGE CALCULATIONS IN VOLVING LARGE NUMBERS. IT WAS BUILT AS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN IBM AND HARVARD IN THE YEAR 1944",
"FIRST GENERATION COMPUTERS": "IN THE YEAR 1940-1956, IT WAS REFERRED TO AS THE FIRST GENERATION OF COMPUTERS. THESE MACHINES ARE SLOW, HUGE, AND EXPENSIVE",
"SECOND GENERATION COMPUTERS": "IN YEAR 1957-1963, IT WAS REFFERED TO THE SECOND GENERATION OF COMPUTERS. IT USED TRANSISTORS WHICH ARE CHEAP IN COST",
"THIRD GENERATION COMPUTERS": "IN YEAR 1964-1971, INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (IC'S) WERE USED INSTEAD OF TRANSISTORS. IT WAS MORE RELIABLE, EFFICIENT, AND SMALLER IN SIZE",
"FOURTH GENERATION COMPUTERS": "IN YEAR 1971-1980, VLSI (VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATED) CIRCUITS WERE USED. THESE COMPUTERS ARE MORE COMPACT, POWERFUL, FAST, AND AFFORDABLE",
"FIFTH GENERATION COMPUTERS": "IN YEAR 1980 TO TILL DATE, IT USED ULSI (ULTRA LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION) TECHNOLOGY. IT ALSO USED PARALLEL HARDWARE AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLEGENCE (AI)",
"ANALOG COMPUTERS": "THESE COMPUTERS ARE USED TO PROCESS DATA GENERATED BY ONGOING PHYSICAL PROCESSES",
"SUPERCOMPUTERS": "THESE ARE THE MOST POWERFUL AND EXPENSIVE COMPUTERS USED FOR COMPLEX SCIENTIFIC CALCULATIONS, SIMULATIONS, AND RESESRCH",
"MINICOMPUTERS": "THESE ARE SMALLER AND LESS POWERFUL THAN MAINFRAME COMPUTERS BUT THEY ARE STILL CAPABLE OF HANDLING MULTIPLE USERS",
"PERSONAL COMPUTERS": "THESE ARE SMALL AND AFFORDABLE COMPUTERS THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR INDIVIDUAL USERS",
"CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT": "MAIN PROCESSING UNIT OF A COMPUTER",
"DIGITAL COMPUTER": "A TYPE OF COMPUTER THAT PROCESSES DATA IN DISCRETE FORM",
